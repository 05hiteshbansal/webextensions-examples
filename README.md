# webextensions-examples
Example Firefox add-ons created using the [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) API.

To use these examples, you need at least Firefox 45. Some examples rely on
APIs that were added in more recent versions of Firefox. To check the minimum
version of Firefox needed for a given example, see the `strict_min_version`
part of the [applications key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/applications) in the example's manifest.json file.

To test out an extension in Firefox, see [Packaging and Installation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Packaging_and_installation).

To see details of each extension, what it does and what it demonstrates, see the [WebExtensions Examples page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Examples).
